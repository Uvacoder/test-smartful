      "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Picasso, Matisse and other modernists.",
      "Born into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his style—revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters—was fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic."

      "The Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1–3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North.",
      "After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade."

In works such as The Garden Party and The Memorandum, Havel used an absurdist style to criticize communism. After participating in the Prague Spring and being blacklisted after the Soviet bloc's invasion of Czechoslovakia, he became more politically active and helped found several dissident initiatives, including Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted. His political activities brought him under the surveillance of the secret police and he spent multiple periods imprisoned, the longest being nearly four years, between 1979 and 1983.",

The municipality is slightly larger, as it includes another 46 islands and islets, covering a total area of approximately 56 km². Lastovo, like the rest of Roman Dalmatia, was settled by Illyrians. Around the year 1000, the Venetians attacked the island due to its participation in piracy along the Adriatic, destroying the settlement. In the 13th century, Lastovo joined the Dubrovnik Republic, where it mostly enjoyed a certain level of autonomy until the republic's conquest by the French under Napoleon. Austria then ruled the island for the next two centuries until it finally became a part of Croatia. The island is noted for its 15th and 16th century architecture. There are a large number of churches for the island's size, a testament to the island's long-standing Roman Catholic tradition. Lastovo's major cultural event, aside from the normal celebrations on the Catholic calendar, is the event known as the Poklad. The island relies primarily on its history and natural beauty to attract tourists.",

Both of the \"frieze\" homographs derive from French, but each entered that language through a different channel. The woolen homograph is from the Middle Dutch word \"vriese,\" which also refers to coarse wool. The \"frieze\" that we are featuring as our word today is from the Latin word \"frisium,\" meaning \"embroidered cloth.\" That word evolved from \"phrygium\" and \"Phrygia,\" the name of an ancient country of Asia Minor whose people excelled in metalwork, wood carving, and (unsurprisingly) embroidery. That embroidery lineage influenced the use of \"frieze\" for the middle division of an entablature, which commonly has a decorated surface resembling embroidered cloth."
