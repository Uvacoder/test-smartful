      "The Austro-Prussian War or Seven Weeks' War was a war fought in 1866 between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, with each also being aided by various allies within the German Confederation. Prussia had also allied with the Kingdom of Italy, linking this conflict to the Third Independence War of Italian unification. The Austro-Prussian War was part of the wider rivalry between Austria and Prussia, and resulted in Prussian dominance over the German states.",
      "The major result of the war was a shift in power among the German states away from Austrian and towards Prussian hegemony. It resulted in the abolition of the German Confederation and its partial replacement by the unification of all of the northern German states in the North German Confederation that excluded Austria and the other Southern German states, a Kleindeutsches Reich. The war also resulted in the Italian annexation of the Austrian province of Venetia."

    ],
    "origin": "The homophones \"complaisant\" and \"complacent\" are often confused -- and no wonder. Not only do they look and sound alike, but they also both derive ultimately from Latin \"complacēre,\" meaning \"to please greatly.\" \"Complacent\" usually means \"self-satisfied\" or \"unconcerned,\" but it also shares with \"complaisant\" the sense of \"marked by an inclination to please or oblige.\" This sense of \"complacent\" is an old one, but that hasn't kept language critics from labeling it as an error -- and on the whole, modern writers do prefer \"complaisant\" for this meaning. Conversely, \"complaisant\" is sometimes mistakenly used in contexts such as \"complaisant about injustices,\" where \"complacent,\" with its sense of \"marked by self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies,\" should go. One aid is to remember that with the preposition \"about,\" you probably want \"complacent.\""
