      "Kanō Hōgai was a Meiji era Japanese artist of the Kanō school. As one of the last Kanō artists, he helped pioneer the nihonga art style with Hashimoto Gahō and art critic Ernest Fenollosa. Hōgai's work reflected the deep traditional style of the school whilst still showing experimentation and influence with western method and art. Hōgai is perhaps most well known for his paintings of dragons, birds, and Bhuddist gods such as Kannon.",
      "The son of the local daimyō's chief painter, he was sent at the age of 18 to Edo to study painting formally. He would stay there for ten years, and study under Kanō Shōsen'in and other great artists of the time. Hōgai would eventually be called upon for such esteemed commissions as ceiling paintings for Edo Castle. He also received the honor of having some of his works displayed at the 1876 Paris International Exposition.",
      "However, despite these honors, the economic turmoil created by the fall of the shogunate in 1868 forced Hōgai to seek to support himself with income via more mundane methods. He worked casting iron, reclaiming land, and running a shop selling writing instruments."

      "The Arab Cold War was a period of political rivalry in the Arab world that occurred as part of the broader Cold War between, approximately, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that brought President Gamal Abdel Nasser to power in that country, and the 1979 Iranian Revolution which led Arab-Iranian tensions to eclipse intra-Arab strife. On one side were newly-established republics, led by Nasser's Egypt, and on the other side were traditionalist kingdoms led by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Nasser espoused secular, pan-Arab nationalism and socialism as a response to the Islamism and rentierism of the kingdoms, as well as their perceived complicity in Western meddling in the region. He also established himself as the foremost defender of Arab and Palestinian honor against the humiliation brought on by the independence of Israel and its victory in the 1948 war. Gradually, so-called Nasserism gained the support of other Arab presidents as they replaced monarchies in their countries, notably in Syria, Iraq, Libya, North Yemen, and Sudan. A number of attempts to unite these states in various configurations were made, but all ultimately failed."

      "The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire. In 1002, the duchy was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, and became the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198, reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century. Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century. The Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars, which resulted in a period of confessional pluralism and relative religious tolerance."

      "\"I cast the miserable _trammels_ of worldly discretion to the winds, and spoke with the fervour that filled me….\" -- From Wilkie Collins' 1868 novel _The Moonstone_",
      "\"Those details remind us that we're at a modern play, one in which the author rejects the _trammels_ of a genre that, to be honest, are extremely familiar.\" -- From a theater review by Judith Newmark in _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_, June 15, 2011"

    "origin": "A trammel fishing net traditionally has three layers, with the middle one finer-meshed and slack so that fish passing through the first net carry some of the center net through the coarser third net and are trapped. Appropriately, \"trammel\" traces back to the Late Latin \"tremaculum,\" which comes from Latin \"tres,\" meaning \"three,\" and \"macula,\" meaning \"mesh.\" Today, \"trammels\" is synonymous with \"restraints,\" and \"trammel\" is also used as a verb meaning \"to confine\" or \"to enmesh.\" You may also run across the adjective \"untrammeled,\" meaning \"not confined or limited.\""
