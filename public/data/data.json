        "Hieronymus Cock, or Hieronymus Wellens de Cock was a Flemish painter and etcher as well as a publisher and distributor of prints. Cock is regarded as one of the most important print publishers of his time in northern Europe. His publishing house played a key role in the transformation of printmaking from an activity of individual artists and craftsmen into an industry based on division of labour. His house published more than 1,100 prints between 1548 and his death in 1570, a vast number by earlier standards.",
        "While far more important and influential as a publisher, Cock was also an artist of talent, as seen in his last series of 12 landscape etchings of 1558, which are somewhat in the fantastic style of the paintings of his brother Matthys Cock. Altogether he etched 62 plates."

        "Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, OM, RA was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Born in Dronryp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. A classical-subject painter, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean Sea and sky. Alma-Tadema was considered one of the most popular Victorian painters. Though admired during his lifetime for his draftsmanship and depictions of Classical antiquity, his work fell into disrepute after his death, and only since the 1960s has it been re-evaluated for its importance within nineteenth-century British art."

A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens, the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the first three decades of the 17th century.",
        "Brueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century. He further created genre paintings that were imitations, pastiches and reworkings of his father's works, in particular his father's genre scenes and landscapes with peasants. Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification."

It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state, but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua, but grew up in Irapuato, Guanajuato, at least from the age of six. The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol, who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros. Siqueiros changed his given name to \"David\" after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo's David."

In 1878 Lesser left school to apprentice with a tradesman, and the next year he went to Düsseldorf to study painting at the Kunstakademie. Ury spent time in Brussels, Paris, Stuttgart, and other locations, before returning to Berlin in 1887.",
        "His first exhibition was in 1889 and met with a hostile reception, although he was championed by Adolph von Menzel whose influence induced the Akademie to award Ury a prize. In 1893 he joined the Munich Secession, one of the several Secessions formed by progressive artists in Germany and Austria in the last years of the 19th century. In 1901 he returned to Berlin, where he exhibited with the Berlin Secession, first in 1915 and notably in 1922, when he had a major exhibition. By this time Ury's critical reputation had grown and his paintings and pastels were in demand."

Like other contemporary pre-Victorian caricaturists like James Gillray, he too depicted characters in bawdy postures and he also produced erotica which was censured by the 1840s. His caricatures included those of people in power such as the Duchess of Devonshire, William Pitt and Napoleon Bonaparte."

Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".",

They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation."

Marco, and his original name Baccio della Porta, was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects. He spent all his career in Florence until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome. He trained with Cosimo Roselli and in the 1490s fell under the influence of Savonarola, which led him to become a Dominican friar in 1500, renouncing painting for several years.",
        "He was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504, and then developed an idealized High Renaissance style, seen in his Vision of St Bernard of that year, now in poor condition but whose \"figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young Raphael with the force of revelation\".",
        "He remained friends with Raphael, and each influenced the other.",
        "His portrait of Savonarola remains the best known image of the reformer. Fra Bartolomeo painted both in oils and fresco, and some of his drawings are pure landscape sketches that are the earliest of this type from any Italian artist."

The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is Early Spring, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called \"the angle of totality.\" This type of visual representation is also called \"Floating Perspective\", a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation.",

        "Henri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp was a French-American painter, sculptor, chess player, and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, Dada, and conceptual art. He was careful about his use of the term Dada and was not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art, and he had a seminal influence on the development of conceptual art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists as \"retinal\" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to use art to serve the mind."

His family, and himself, were art collectors and Ming dynasty aristocrats. He had studied for the civil service exam under the Ming and received the xiucai degree in his twenties. However he abandoned any attempt at an official career after the Manchu conquest. Subsequent to the 1670s he moved, or fled, depending on the source, to Yangzhou. As a calligrapher he was influenced by Dong Qichang and Mi Fu. His landscapes were more influenced by Hong Ren and Ni Zan. His later works are considered to have had a more moist and expressive feel than those of Hong Ren. As a person he was said to be easy-going, but slightly reclusive. He also had a fondness for drink, indulging into the late hours."

He has been called \"Japan's greatest lacquerer\", but his reputation as painter and print artist is more complex: In Japan, he is known as both too modern, a panderer to the Westernization movement, and also an overly conservative traditionalist who did nothing to stand out from his contemporaries. Despite holding this complicated reputation in Japan, Zeshin has come to be well regarded and much studied among the art world of the West, in Britain and the United States in particular."

As an artist, he is often cited along with his pupil, Guan Tong, as one of the most critical figures in the development of the style of monumental landscape painting which appeared near the end of the Five Dynasties period. Later this style would come to be known as the Northern Landscape style; it strongly influenced the tradition of Northern Song painters. As a theorist, he is the person most responsible for codifying the theories underlying the work of later painters, and his treatises on painting and aesthetics continued to serve as textbooks for Northern Song artists more than a century after his death."

He achieved early fame with his design for the Castel Beranger, the first Art Nouveau apartment building in Paris, which was selected in an 1899 competition as one of the best new building facades in the city. He is best known for the glass and iron edicules or canopies, with ornamental Art Nouveau curves, which he designed to cover the entrances of the first stations of the Paris Metro.",
        "Between 1890 and 1930, Guimard designed and built some fifty buildings, in addition to one hundred and forty-one subway entrances for Paris Metro, as well as numerous pieces of furniture and other decorative works. However, in the 1910s Art Nouveau went out of fashion and by the 1960s most of his works had been demolished, and only two of his original Metro edicules were still in place. Guimard's critical reputation revived in the 1960s, in part due to subsequent acquisitions of his work by Museum of Modern Art, and art historians have noted the originality and importance of his architectural and decorative works."

Combining exacting botanical observation and loosely Cubist abstraction, his watercolors of flowers, fruit and vegetables have a magical liveliness and an almost shocking sensuousness.\"",

He graduated from Franklin & Marshall Academy before studying at Drexel University and at Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While he was a student at PAFA, he participated in a show at the Academy, and also met William Carlos Williams at his boarding house. The two were fast friends and remained close for the rest of their lives.",

Rossetti was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. His work also influenced the European Symbolists and was a major precursor of the Aesthetic movement.",

His later poetry was characterised by the complex interlinking of thought and feeling, especially in his sonnet sequence, The House of Life. Poetry and image are closely entwined in Rossetti's work. He frequently wrote sonnets to accompany his pictures, spanning from The Girlhood of Mary Virgin and Astarte Syriaca, while also creating art to illustrate poems such as Goblin Market by the celebrated poet Christina Rossetti, his sister."

The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a 'wiping away' technique."

        "After his own self-study in art as a young man, Tanner enrolled in 1879 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. The only black student, he became a favorite of the painter Thomas Eakins, who had recently begun teaching there. Tanner made other connections among artists, including Robert Henri. In the late 1890s he was sponsored for a trip to the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem by Rodman Wanamaker, who was impressed by his paintings of biblical themes."

        "Guys was born and baptized in Vlissingen, the son of François Lazare Guys and his second wife, Elisabeth Bétin. His father had been appointed civilian chief of the French Navy in Rochefort in 1795 and was stationed in Vlissingen fom 1800 until 1806, after which the family moved to Calais. At the age of 20, Constantin served in the cavalry, but only a little later toured in Greece with Lord Byron. His career as an artist didn't start until he was about 40.",
        "Baudelaire called him the \"painter of modern life,\" and wrote a long essay on Guys in which he extensively praised his works, under the pseudonym \"Monsieur G\". Robert de Montesquiou wrote a review of Guys that acknowledged Baudelaire's essay, compared Guys favorably to Whistler, and emphasized his portrayal of details of women's clothing, and horse carriages. His subjects were Second French Empire life. In the Dutch novel \"Au pair\" by W. F. Hermans, one of the main characters is fascinated by Constantin Guys. Guys died in Paris, aged 90."

Following the Russian Revolution, Kandinsky \"became an insider in the cultural administration of Anatoly Lunacharsky\" and helped establish the Museum of the Culture of Painting. However, by then \"his spiritual outlook... was foreign to the argumentative materialism of Soviet society\", and opportunities beckoned in Germany, to which he returned in 1920. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933."

Unlike many other Orientalist painters who took a salacious interest in the women of the Middle East, he \"never painted a nude\", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes."

He was successful as an independent painter in his late teens, and became a master in the Antwerp guild in 1618. By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, Peter Paul Rubens, who became a major influence on his work. Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired Iconography series of portrait etchings, mostly of other artists. He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess Isabella, Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of Charles I of England."

        "The Spanish Civil War was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939. Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic, in alliance with anarchists, of the communist and syndicalist variety, fought against a revolt by the Nationalists, an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives and Catholics, led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a war of religion, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. It has been frequently called the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.",

The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region, and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions. That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine–American War.",
        "The main issue was Cuban independence. Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule. The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish–American War. There had been war scares before, as in the Virginius Affair in 1873, but in the late 1890s, American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities. The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains. It lobbied vigorously against going to war. President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated yellow press and sought a peaceful settlement."

        "Both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the Italian occupation forces until the Italian capitulation, and thereon also with German and Ustashe forces."

These negotiations took place between the governing National Party, the African National Congress, and a wide variety of other political organisations. Negotiations took place against a backdrop of political violence in the country, including allegations of a state-sponsored third force destabilising the country. The negotiations resulted in South Africa's first non-racial election, which was won by the African National Congress."

        "The conflict began on 2 April, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.",
        "The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841."

Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties, the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with more than a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele, in 1917, with 487,000 casualties."

The stories about the battle are first found centuries after it allegedly occurred; according to them, it was fought near Clavijo between Christians, led by Ramiro I of Asturias, and Muslims, led by the Emir of Córdoba.",

He became the patron saint of Spain and is known to Spaniards as Santiago Matamoros. Aspects of the historical Battle of Monte Laturce were incorporated into this legend, as Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz demonstrated in 1948. The date originally assigned to the battle, 834, was changed in modern times to 844 to suit the inherent contradictions of the account. The day is sometimes given as 23 May."

      "definition": "A person who secretly watches others, especially for sexual gratification; a voyeur. For example, *The police caught a peeping Tom right outside their house.* This expression, first recorded in 1796, alludes to the legend of the tailor Tom, the only person to watch the naked Lady Godiva as she rode by and who was struck blind for this sin."

      "term": "Philadelphia lawyer",
      "definition": "A shrewd attorney, adept at dealing with legal technicalities, as in *It would take a Philadelphia lawyer to get him off.* This expression dates from the late 1700s and, as lexicographer Richard H. Thornton observed: \"Why members of the Philadelphia bar should be credited with superhuman sagacity has never been satisfactorily explained.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "well heeled",
      "definition": "Well off, prosperous. In the 1700s this term was used to describe a cock whose spurs had been sharpened prior to a cockfight. In the 1800s it came to mean \"well armed,\" and later in that century it acquired its present sense. For example, *The Coopers must be well heeled to afford two country club memberships.*"

    {
      "term": "hell has no fury like a woman scorned",
      "definition": "No anger is worse than that of a jilted woman. For example, *Nancy has nothing good to say about Tom---hell has no fury, you know.* This term is a shortening of William Congreve's lines, \"Heav'n has no rage, like love to hatred turn'd, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorn'd\" (*The Mourning Bride,* 1697). Today the proverb is often shortened even more, as in the example, and is also often put as **hell hath no fury....**"

      "definition": "A dupe or tool for another, a sucker, as in *You always try to make a cat's paw of me, but I refuse to do any more of your work.* This term alludes to a very old tale about a monkey that persuades a cat to pull chestnuts out of the fire so as to avoid burning its own paws. The story dates from the 16th century and versions of it (some with a dog) exist in many languages."

    {
      "term": "swan song",
      "definition": "A final accomplishment or performance, one's last work.

Although the idea is much older, the term was first recorded in English only in 1890."

      "term": "in for a penny, in for a pound",
      "definition": "Once involved, one must not stop at half- measures. For example, *All right, I'll drive you all the way there---in for a penny, in for a pound.* This term originally meant that if one owes a penny one might as well owe a pound, and came into American use without changing the British monetary unit to *dollar.* [Late 1600s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "build on sand",
      "definition": "Use an unstable foundation, as in *If you buy nothing but high-risk stocks, your portfolio will be built on sand.* This metaphor appears in the New Testament, where Jesus likens those who do not heed his sayings to a foolish man who builds his house on sand, which then is washed away by rain, flood, and wind (Matthew 7:24--27). [c. 1600]"
    },

      "term": "absent without leave",
      "definition": "Away without permission or explanation, as in *Her daughter went to the mall but got in trouble for being absent without leave.* The term and its acronym, **AWOL,** originated in the American military during World War I for soldiers absent from duty without permission (leave).

    {
      "term": "hang out one's shingle",
      "definition": "Open an office, especially a professional practice, as in *Bill's renting that office and hanging out his shingle next month.* This American colloquialism dates from the first half of the 1800s, when at first lawyers, and later also doctors and business concerns, used shingles for signboards."
    },
    {
      "term": "stamping ground",
      "definition": "Also, **old stamping ground, stomping ground.** A habitual or favorite haunt, as in *Whenever we visit, we go back to our old stamping ground, the drugstore nearest the high school.* This term alludes to a traditional gathering place for horses or cattle, which stamp down the ground with their hooves. [Early 1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "the exception proves the rule",
      "definition": "An instance that does not obey a rule shows that the rule exists. For example, *John's much shorter than average but excels at basketball---the exception proves the rule.* This seemingly paradoxical phrase is the converse of the older idea that every rule has an exception. [Mid-1600s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "spit and polish",
      "definition": "Close attention to appearance and order, as in *With a little spit and polish this house will sell very quickly.* This expression originated in the military, presumably alluding to literally shining up something with the aid of a little saliva. There it also came to mean \"too much attention to appearance, and not enough to more important concerns,\" as in *The commander is so concerned with spit and polish that he overlooks the crew's morale.* [Late 1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "take down a notch",
      "definition": "Also, **take down a peg.** Deflate or humble someone, as in *He's so arrogant that I wish someone would take him down a notch,* or *That defeat took them down a peg.* Both *notch* and *peg* in this idiom allude to a series, the former of indentations, the latter of knobs, used to raise or lower something. Specifically, *peg* alludes to the pegs used to lower a ship's colors. Their figurative use dates from the second half of the 1600s."
    },
    {
      "term": "wet behind the ears",
      "definition": "Also, **not dry behind the ears.** Immature, inexperienced, as in *How can you take instructions from Tom? He's still wet behind the ears,* or *Jane's not dry behind the ears yet.* This term alludes to the fact that the last place to dry in a newborn colt or calf is the indentation behind its ears. [Early 1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "that ain't hay",
      "definition": "That's a great deal, especially of money; also, that's important. For example, *He's making ten thousand a month, and that ain't hay.* Originally used to describe a sum of money that is large, this phrase was later extended to other circumstances, as in *She married a titled lord, and that ain't hay.* [Colloquial; first half of 1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "let the cat out of the bag",
      "definition": "Give away a secret, as in *Mom let the cat out of the bag and told us Karen was engaged.* This expression alludes to the dishonest practice of a merchant substituting a worthless cat for a valuable pig, which is discovered only when the buyer gets home and opens the bag. [Mid-1700s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "there's no fool like an old fool",
      "definition": "An old fool is the worst kind of fool, as in *He's marrying a woman fifty years his junior---there's no fool like an old fool.* This adage, now considered somewhat offensive for stereotyping old people, appeared in John Heywood's 1546 proverb collection and has been repeated ever since."
    },
    {
      "term": "on the qui vive",
      "definition": "On the alert, vigilant, as in *The police have been warned to be on the qui vive for terrorists.* This expression, containing the French words for \"[long] live who?\" originated as a sentinel's challenge to determine a person's political sympathies. The answer expected of allies was something like *vive le roi* (\"long live the king\"). It was taken over into English with its revised meaning in the early 1700s, the first recorded use being in 1726."
    },
    {
      "term": "set one's cap for",
      "definition": "Pursue someone romantically, as in *We all thought Anne had set her cap for Joe, but we were wrong.* In the 1700s this term, which may have alluded to donning one's best headgear, was applied to members of either sex, but by the early 1800s it generally described a woman chasing a man. It is probably obsolescent."
    },
    {
      "term": "gild the lily",
      "definition": "Add unnecessary adornment or supposed improvement. For example, *Offering three different desserts after that elaborate meal would be gilding the lily.* This expression is a condensation of Shakespeare's metaphor in *King John* (4:2): \"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily... is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\" [c. 1800]"
    },
    {
      "term": "fiddle while Rome burns",
      "definition": "Occupy oneself with unimportant matters and neglect important ones during a crisis.

[Mid- 1600s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "forever and a day",
      "definition": "**1\\.** For a very long time, as in *He's been working on that book forever and a day.* This hyperbolic expression probably originated as a corruption of the now obsolete *for ever and ay.* Shakespeare used it in *The Taming of the Shrew* (4:4): \"Farewell for ever and a day.\" Today it is mainly a substitute for \"very long time.\" [c. 1600] **2\\.** Incessantly, ceaselessly, as in *Will this racket never end? It's been going on forever and a day.* [Colloquial; first half of 1900s]"

      "term": "forty winks",
      "definition": "A brief nap, as in *There's just time for forty winks before we have to leave.* This expression supposedly was first recorded in 1828 and relies on *wink* in the sense of \"sleep,\" a usage dating from the 14th century."

    {
      "term": "all wool and a yard wide",
      "definition": "Genuine, not fake; of excellent quality; also, honorable. For example, *You can count on Ned---he's all wool and a yard wide.* This metaphorical term alludes to a length of highly valued pure-wool cloth that measures exactly a yard (and not an inch less). [Late 1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "can't see beyond the end of one's nose",
      "definition": "Also, **can't see farther than the end of one's nose.** Lack foresight, envisioning only immediate events or problems, as in *Thomas hasn't hired an orchestra for the Christmas concert; he just can't see beyond the end of his nose.* This expression originated as a French proverb that was frequently cited in English from about 1700 on. Alexander Pope used a similar expression in his *Essay on Man* (1734): \"Onward still he goes, Yet ne'er looks forward further than his nose.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "darken someone's door",
      "definition": "Come unwanted to someone's home, as in *I told him to get out and never darken my door again.* The verb *darken* here refers to casting one's shadow across the *threshold,* a word that occasionally was substituted for *door.* As an imperative, the expression is associated with Victorian melodrama, where someone (usually a young woman or man) is thrown out of the parental home for some misdeed, but it is actually much older. Benjamin Franklin used it in *The Busybody* (1729): \"I am afraid she would resent it so as never to darken my doors again.\""

    {
      "term": "green about the gills",
      "definition": "Also, **green around the gills.** Looking ill or nauseated, as in *After that bumpy ride she looked quite green about the gills.* The use of *green* to describe an ailing person's complexion dates from about 1300, and *gills* has referred to the flesh around human jaws and ears since the 1600s. Although in the 1800s *white* and *yellow* were paired with *gills* to suggest illness, the alliterative *green* has survived them."

      "term": "clean someone's clock",
      "definition": "Beat, thrash, or defeat someone decisively, as in *He's much bigger than you and could easily clean your clock.* This term originated in the military. The use of *clock* is unclear but possibly alludes to hitting someone in the face (for \"clockface\"). [Slang; mid-1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "both feet on the ground",
      "definition": "A sensible, realistic, or practical outlook. For example, *You can count on Tom not to get cheated in that deal; he has both feet on the ground,* or *Jean is a dreamer; but her husband is a man with both feet on the ground.* [Mid-1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "shake the dust from one's feet",
      "definition": "Depart in a hurry, especially from an unpleasant situation; also, leave forever.

[Mid-1500s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "give an inch and they'll take a mile",
      "definition": "Make a small concession and they'll take advantage of you. For example, *I told her she could borrow the car for one day and she's been gone a week---give an inch!* This expression, in slightly different form, was already a proverb in John Heywood's 1546 collection, \"Give him an inch and he'll take an ell,\" and is so well known it is often shortened (as in the example). The use of *mile* dates from about 1900."
    },
    {
      "term": "wash one's dirty linen in public",
      "definition": "Also **air one's dirty linen** or **laundry.** Expose private matters to public view, especially unsavory secrets. These metaphors are reworkings of a French proverb, *Il faut laver son linge sale en famille* (\"One should wash one's dirty linen at home\"), which was quoted by Napoleon on his return from Elba (1815). It was first recorded in English in 1867."
    },
    {
      "term": "typhoid Mary",
      "definition": "A carrier or spreader of misfortune, as in *I swear he's a typhoid Mary; everything at the office has gone wrong since he was hired.* This expression alludes to a real person, Mary Manson, who died in 1938. A servant, she transmitted typhoid fever to others and was referred to as \"typhoid Mary\" from the early 1900s. The term was broadened to other carriers of calamity in the mid-1900s."
    },
    {
      "term": "a month of Sundays",
      "definition": "A long time, as in *I haven't seen Barbara in a month of Sundays.* This expression, which would literally mean thirty weeks, has been used hyperbolically since it was first recorded in 1832. One writer suggests it originally connoted a long *dreary* time, since games and other kinds of amusement used to be forbidden on Sunday."
    },
    {
      "term": "pass muster",
      "definition": "Meet a required standard, as in *That yard cleanup won't pass muster with Mom.* This expression originally meant \"to undergo a military review without censure,\" *muster* referring to an assembling of troops for inspection or a similar purpose. [Late 1500s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "can't get blood from a stone",
      "definition": "This is a hopeless source of money, comfort, or some other kind of succor. The analogy has been employed since 1660. Charles Dickens used it often, as in *David Copperfield* (1850): *\"*Blood cannot be obtained from a stone, nor can anything of account be obtained at present from Mr. Micawber [a perennially insolvent character]. A 19th-century variant is **can't get blood from a turnip**, but it is heard less often today."
    },
    {
      "term": "stuff and nonsense",
      "definition": "Utter foolishness or absurdity, as in *Stuff and nonsense, of course I can pack a suitcase.* Often used as an interjection, this idiom employs *stuff* in the sense of \"rubbish.\" It was first recorded in 1749."
    },
    {
      "term": "over the transom",
      "definition": "Unasked for, unsolicited. The term comes from publishing, where it describes a manuscript simply sent to a firm in hopes of arousing its interest. It has persisted even though few offices still have a transom, a small opening at the top of a door used for ventilation, and unsolicited manuscripts usually come through the mail or over the Internet rather than being thrown up through a window. [Colloquial, first half of 1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "cast pearls before swine",
      "definition": "Give something of value to someone who won't appreciate it, as in *The old professor felt that lecturing on Dante to unruly undergraduates would be casting pearls before swine.* This term comes from the New Testament (Matthew 7:6), appearing in Tyndale's translation (1526). It was repeated often by writers from Shakespeare to Dickens and remains current."
    },
    {
      "term": "odor of sanctity",
      "definition": "Exaggerated or hypocritical piety, an assumption of moral superiority, as in *This candidate puts off some voters with his odor of sanctity.* This expression, originating in the medieval idea that the dead body of a saintly individual gives off a sweet smell, was used to describe saintliness in the mid-1700s. Today it is generally used ironically."
    },
    {
      "term": "whistle in the dark",
      "definition": "Summon up courage in a frightening situation, make a show of bravery. For example, *They knew they were lost and were just whistling in the dark.* This expression alludes to a literal attempt to keep up one's courage. [First half of 1900s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "many happy returns",

    },
    {
      "term": "skid row",
      "definition": "A squalid district inhabited by derelicts and vagrants; also, a life of impoverished dissipation. For example, *That part of town is our skid row,* or *His drinking was getting so bad we thought he was headed for skid row.* This expression originated in the lumber industry, where a *skid road* was a road or track made of logs laid crosswise over which logs were slid. Around 1900 the name *Skid Road* was used for the part of a town frequented by loggers, which had many bars and brothels, and by the 1930s the variant *skid row,* with its current meaning, came into use."
    },
    {
      "term": "rob Peter to pay Paul",
      "definition": "Take from one to give to another, shift resources. For example, *They took out a second mortgage on their house so they could buy a condo in Florida---they're robbing Peter to pay Paul.* Although legend has it that this expression alludes to appropriating the estates of St. Peter's Church, in Westminster, London, to pay for the repairs of St. Paul's Cathedral in the 1800s, the saying first appeared in a work by John Wycliffe about 1382."
    },

      "term": "a flea in one's ear",
      "definition": "An annoying hint or a stinging rebuke, as in *He has a flea in his ear about their relationship,* or *If he doesn't bring the right equipment, I'll put a flea in his ear.* This expression originated in French and has been used in English since the 1400s."
    },
    {
      "term": "fifth wheel",
      "definition": "An extra and unnecessary person or thing, as in *He was the only one without a date, so he felt like a fifth wheel.* This expression, which alludes to an unneeded wheel on a four-wheel vehicle, may have originated as long ago as 1631, when Thomas Dekker wrote *Match Me in London:* \"Thou tiest but wings to a swift gray Hounds heel, And addest to a running Chariot a fifth wheel.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "brown bagger",
      "definition": "A person who brings his or her own supplies, as in *The architects of the new office designed a space for brown baggers to eat lunch.* The term originated in the 1930s in Britain for very serious students who carried their books about with them in brown briefcases or bags. That usage crossed the Atlantic within a few decades. However, in America from the 1960s on, it has primarily been used for persons who brought their own liquor in a brown paper bag, either legitimately or surreptitiously, to a public place or restaurant not licensed to sell it, or for those who took their lunch to work."

Joining the Communist Party, which governed the Soviet Union as a one-party state according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine, he rose through its ranks and in 1976 became First Secretary of the party's Sverdlovsk Oblast committee. Initially a supporter of the perestroika reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin later criticised them as being too moderate, calling for a transition to a multi-party representative democracy. In 1987 he was the first person to resign from the party's governing Politburo, establishing his popularity as an anti-establishment figure."

The city steadily grew but went into an extended period of decline following the collapse of the Almohads. In the 17th century Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. The French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912 and made Rabat its administrative center. Morocco achieved independence in 1955 and Rabat became its capital.",

In addition, tourism and the presence of all foreign embassies in Morocco serve to make Rabat one of the most important cities in the country."

The city served as the capital in exile of the Umayyad Caliphate and various other emirates. During these Muslim periods, Córdoba was transformed into a world leading center of education and learning, producing notable figures such as Averroes, Ibn Hazm, and Al-Zahrawi, and by the 10th century it had grown to be the second-largest city in Europe. It was conquered by the Kingdom of Castile through the Christian Reconquista in 1236.",

He was also a proponent of greater collaboration between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. The Prince's interest in ecological issues led him to establish the Bellerive Foundation in the late 1970s, and he was a knowledgeable and respected collector of Islamic art. Born in Paris, France, he was the son of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan and Princess Andrée Aga Khan. He received his early education in Lausanne, Switzerland, before graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1954 from Harvard College. He married twice, but had no children of his own. Prince Sadruddin died of cancer at the age of 70, and was buried in Switzerland."

      "summary": "SheiKra is a steel Dive Coaster roller coaster at the Busch Gardens Tampa Bay amusement park in Tampa, Florida, United States. The name is derived from \"shikra\", an Asian-African hawk that is known to dive vertically for its prey. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride was planned to reach a height of approximately 160 feet (49 m), but this was later changed to 200 feet (61 m). It reaches a maximum speed of 70 miles per hour (110 km/h), and has a total track length of 3,188 feet (972 m). It opened in 2005, and was converted to a floorless roller coaster in 2007, following the opening of its sister Dive Coaster Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. SheiKra was the first Dive Coaster to be constructed in North America; it was also the first of its kind to feature a vertical drop, a splashdown and an Immelmann loop. It broke the records for the world's longest, tallest, and fastest Dive Coaster, but has since lost these records. In 2005, Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards voted it the fourth-best new steel roller coaster of that year (in a three-way tie) and the 28th-best steel roller coaster. It was voted the 30th-best steel roller coaster in 2012."

An advocate of socialism, Mujib became popular for his leadership against the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis. At the heightening of sectional tensions, Mujib outlined a 6-point autonomy plan which was seen as separatism in West Pakistan. After talks broke down with President Yahya Khan and West Pakistani politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Mujib was arrested and a guerrilla war erupted between government forces and Bengali nationalists. Indian intervention in 1971 would lead to the establishment of Bangladesh, and after his release Mujib would assume office as provisional president, and later prime minister. Even as a constitution was adopted, proclaiming socialism and a secular democracy, Mujib struggled to address the challenges of intense poverty and unemployment. Amidst rising political turmoil, he banned other political parties and declared himself president in 1975. Mujib was assassinated with his family by a group of army officers."

D. coccus itself is native to tropical and subtropical South America and Mexico. A primarily sessile parasite, this insect lives on cacti from the genus Opuntia, feeding on plant moisture and nutrients. The insect produces carminic acid that deters predation by other insects. Carminic acid can be extracted from the insect's body and eggs to make carmine dye (also known as cochineal). Carmine is primarily used as a food colouring and for cosmetics. After synthetic pigments and dyes such as alizarin were invented in the late 19th century, natural-dye production gradually diminished. Health fears over artificial food additives, however, have renewed the popularity of cochineal dyes, and the increased demand has made cultivation of the insect profitable again."

      "summary": "A waveguide filter is an electronic filter that is constructed in waveguide technology. Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. Examples are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting. Waveguide filters were developed during World War II for radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications. Post-war development was concerned with reducing size, first with new analysis techniques that eliminated unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and ceramic resonators. Waveguides can support a variety of electromagnetic wave modes: both a disadvantage, spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage; dual-mode designs can be much smaller. The chief advantages of waveguide filters are ability to handle high power and low loss. The chief disadvantages are bulk and cost compared to technologies like microstrip."

Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, and conjuring similarities with the modern rhinoceros, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs. Though it shared the landscape with, and was preyed upon by, the fearsome Tyrannosaurus, it is unclear whether the two battled the way they are commonly depicted in movies and children's dinosaur books. Although no complete skeleton has been found, Triceratops is well known from numerous partial specimens collected since the genus' introduction in 1887. The function of their frills and three distinctive facial horns has long inspired debate. Although traditionally viewed as defensive weapons against predators, the latest theories suggest these features were primarily used in display for courtship and dominance, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats or rhinoceros beetles."

Named for its large deposits of petrified wood, the park covers about 146 square miles (380 km2), encompassing semi-desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands. The site, the northern part of which extends into the Painted Desert, was declared a National Monument in 1906 and a national park in 1962. About 600,000 people visit the park each year and take part in activities including sightseeing, photography, hiking, and backpacking. The Petrified Forest is known for its fossils, especially fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic, about 225 million years ago. The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation, from which the Painted Desert gets its name."

It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field (or occasionally on an artificial pitch) with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal. The predominant feature of the sport is that no players other than the goalkeepers may use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The winner is the team who scores the most goals by the end of the match. The modern game was codified in England following the formation of the Football Association, whose 1863 Laws of the Game created the foundations for the way the sport is played today. Football is governed internationally by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The most prestigious international football competition is the World Cup, played every four years, which is also the most widely viewed and famous sporting event in the world, watched by twice as many people as the Summer Olympics."

Having previously been imprisoned for his role in a failed rebellion and involved in missions to Spain that sought support for persecuted English Catholics, Tresham joined the Gunpowder Plot in October 1605. Its leader, Robert Catesby, asked him to provide a large sum of money and the use of Rushton Hall, but Tresham apparently provided neither, instead giving a small amount of money to fellow plotter Thomas Wintour. Tresham also expressed his concern that two of his brothers-in-law would be killed if the plot succeeded. An anonymous letter delivered to one of them was handed to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and was decisive in foiling the conspiracy. Historians suspect that Tresham wrote it, although this is unproven. Catesby and Wintour thought that Tresham was the author and threatened to kill him, but he convinced them otherwise. Tresham was arrested on 12 November and confined in the Tower of London, where he died of natural causes the following month; his confession did not mention the letter."

Since gaining its independence, Russia claimed to be the legal successor to the Soviet Union on the international stage. However, Russia lost its superpower status amid serious economic and political challenges in the 1990s. Scrapping the socialist central planning and state ownership of property of the Soviet era, Russia attempted to build an economy with elements of market capitalism, with often painful results. The development of post-Soviet political institutions has also produced mixed results. By the early-1990s Russia had a system of multiparty electoral politics, but in recent years the presidency has been increasing its already tight control over parliament, regional officeholders, and civil society."

It generally grows as a small shrub to 2 metres (7 ft) in height, though can be a straggly tree to 6 metres (20 ft). Its inflorescences (flower spikes) are gold or less commonly yellowish, with emergent styles that may be a wide range of colours – from black, purple, red, orange or yellow. The Hairpin Banksia is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. Its floral display and fine foliage have made it a popular garden plant with many horticultural selections available. Given recent trends toward smaller gardens, compact dwarf forms of Banksia spinulosa have become popular; the first available, Banksia 'Birthday Candles', has achieved a great deal of commercial success and wide recognition, and has been followed by several others."

In 2006 it was the fourth-most prescribed antidepressant in the United States retail market, with more than 21 million prescriptions. Bupropion lowers seizure threshold and its potential to cause seizures was widely publicized.

Augustine was the prior of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the Gregorian mission, to Britain to Christianize King Æthelberht of the Kingdom of Kent from his native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Before reaching Kent the missionaries had considered turning back but Gregory urged them on and, in 597, Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury. King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597. Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon priests and missionaries.

The work's 1976 publication was the first time an African American woman had expanded her life story into a third volume. Scholar Dolly McPherson called the book \"a graphic portrait of the adult self in bloom\", while critic Lyman B. Hagen called it \"a journey of discovery and rebirth\". In Singin' and Swingin', Angelou examines many of the same subjects and themes in her previous autobiographies, including travel, music, race, conflict, and motherhood. Angelou depicts the conflict she felt as a single mother, despite her success as a performer as she travels Europe with the musical Porgy and Bess.

      "summary": "Authentic Science Fiction was a British science fiction magazine published in the 1950s that ran for 85 issues. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 as a series of novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it had become a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it had completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine. Authentic published little in the way of important or ground-breaking fiction, though it did print Charles L. Harness's \"The Rose\", which later became well-regarded. The poor rates of pay—£1 per 1,000 words—prevented the magazine from attracting the best writers. During much of its life it competed against three other moderately successful British science fiction magazines, as well as the American science fiction magazine market. Hamilton folded the magazine in October 1957, because they needed cash to finance an investment in the UK rights to an American best-selling novel."

      "summary": "The Leopard 2E is a variant of the German Leopard 2 main battle tank, tailored to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza. The acquisition program for the Leopard 2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program resulted in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and begin the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite production delays due to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard 2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army. The Leopard 2E replaced the M60 Patton tank in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6 million hours worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 1.9 billion euros. It has thicker armor on the turret and glacis plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard 2E is expected to remain in service until 2025."

      "summary": "Banksia ericifolia is a species of woody shrub of the Proteaceae family native to Australia; it occurs in two separate regions of Central and Northern New South Wales east of the Great Dividing Range. Well known for its orange or red autumn inflorescences, which contrast with its green fine-leaved heath-like foliage, it is generally encountered as a medium to large shrub that can reach 6 m (20 ft) high and wide, though is usually half that size. In exposed heathlands and coastal areas it is more often 1–2 m (3–7 ft). Banksia ericifolia was one of the original Banksia species collected by Joseph Banks around Botany Bay in 1770 and was named by Carl Linnaeus the Younger, son of Carolus Linnaeus, in 1782. Banksia ericifolia has been widely grown in Australian gardens on the east coast for many years as well as being used to a limited extent in the cut flower industry. Compact dwarf cultivars such as Banksia 'Little Eric' have become more popular in recent years with the trend toward smaller gardens."

They were active from roughly the late ninth century through the early twelfth century and could be found in areas of Lapland, Russia, and the Byzantine Empire that were frequented by Scandinavian traders, raiders and mercenaries. Scholars differ on whether the Kylfings were ethnically Finnic or Norse. Their geographic origin is also disputed; Denmark, Sweden and the Eastern Baltic are put forward as candidates. Whether the name Kylfing denotes a particular tribal, socio-political, or economic grouping is a matter of much debate. They are mentioned in Old Norse runestone inscriptions, sagas, and poetry, as well as Byzantine records and Rus' law-codes, in which they were afforded significant economic and social privileges. According to the sagas, the Kylfings opposed the consolidation of Norway under Harald Fairhair and participated in the pivotal Battle of Hafrsfjord. After Harald's victory in that battle, they are described in the sagas as having raided in Finnmark and elsewhere in northern Norway and having fought against Harald's lieutenants such as Thorolf Kveldulfsson."

Although capable of living indoors with humans similarly to dogs or cats, pet skunks are relatively rare, partly due to restrictive laws and the complexity of their care. Pet skunks are mainly kept in the United States, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands. In the United States, pet skunks can be purchased from licensed shelters or breeders with a permit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Baby skunk availability peaks during springtime, immediately following the skunk mating season. Some large fur farms sell surplus skunks to pet stores. Most wild skunks only spray as a defense mechanism when injured or attacked. The mercaptan-emitting scent glands are usually removed in pet skunks at about four weeks of age."

Footage is taken mostly from the multiplayer modes of the first-person shooter (FPS) video games Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 on the Xbox video game console. Chronicling the story of two opposing teams of soldiers fighting a civil war in the middle of a desolate box canyon, the series is an absurdist parody of FPS games, military life, and other science fiction films. Begun in 2003 and having concluded its fourth season, Red vs Blue has won four awards from the Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences. The series is generally praised for its originality, and has been credited with bringing new popularity to machinima, helping it to gain more mainstream exposure, and attracting more people to the art form."

It is surrounded by the eyewall, where the most severe weather of a cyclone occurs. The cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye, and can be as much as 15% lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm. The eye is possibly the most recognizable feature of tropical cyclones. Surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms, the eye is a roughly-circular area at the cyclone's center of circulation. In strong tropical cyclones, the eye is characterised by light winds and clear skies, surrounded on all sides by a towering, symmetric eyewall. In weaker tropical cyclones, the eye is less well-defined, and can be covered by the central dense overcast, which is an area of high, thick clouds which show up brightly on satellite pictures. Weaker or disorganized storms may also feature an eyewall which does not completely encircle the eye, or have an eye which features heavy rain."

At the outbreak of World War I, Emden captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the commerce raider Cormoran. In October 1914, Emden launched a surprise attack on Penang, sinking the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet. Emden's commander, Karl von Müller, then took her to raid the Cocos Islands, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. On 9 November 1914, Emden was attacked by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney, a more powerful ship, and seriously damaged. Müller ran his ship aground to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner, though the landing party commandeered an old schooner and eventually returned to Germany. Emden's wreck was quickly destroyed by wave action, but was not broken up for scrap until the 1950s."

Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After the advent of the telegraph, simultaneous observations of weather became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II. Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information."

Known to hunt, as well as to scavenge carrion, communal eating is one of the few social activities in which the usually solitary devil participates. The Tasmanian Devil became extinct on the Australian mainland about 400 years prior to European settlement in 1788. The people of Tasmania saw devils as a threat to livestock and hunted them until 1941, when the animals were officially protected. Since the late 1990s devil facial tumour disease has reduced the devil population significantly and threatens the survival of the species.

Other successful roles at the theatre followed, but he left in 1806 to take up theatrical residencies at the Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells theatres. As he matured, he began performing as Clown, for which character he created the whiteface make-up design still used in pantomime and by many other clowns today. The numerous injuries he received as a result of his energetic performances eventually led to a decline in his health and to his semi-retirement in 1823.

Cerro Azul is responsible for South America's largest recorded eruptions, in 1846 and 1932. In 1846, an effusive eruption formed the vent at the site of present-day Quizapu Crater on the northern flank of Cerro Azul and sent lava flowing down the sides of the volcano, creating a lava field of 8–9 square kilometers (3–3.5 square miles). In 1932, one of the largest explosive eruptions of the 20th century occurred at Quizapu Crater and sent 9.5 cubic kilometers (2.3 cu mi) of ash into the atmosphere. The volcano's most recent eruption was in 1967. The South Volcanic Zone has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to the surrounding region. Any volcanic hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife.

      "didYouKnow": "\"His horse \\[is\\] . . . troubled with the lampas, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins. . . .\" Petruchio's poor, decrepit horse in Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ is beset by just about every known equine malady, including a kind of swelling in the mouth (lampas), skin lesions (fashions), tumors on his fetlocks (windgalls), and bony enlargements on his hocks (spavins). The spavins alone can be enough to render a horse lame and useless. In the 17th century, \"spavined\" horses brought to mind other things that are obsolete, out-of-date, or long past their prime, and we began using the adjective figuratively. \"Spavined\" still serves a purpose, despite its age. It originated in Middle English as \"spaveyned\" and can be traced to the Middle French word for \"spavin,\" which was \"espavain.\"",
