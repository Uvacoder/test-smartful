In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the Baroque art of the 17th century and the Rococo art of the 18th century.

He was also regarded as one of the first to create monumental oil paintings with epic Chinese themes – a show of his high proficiency in an essential Western art technique. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of \"The Four Great Academy Presidents\"."

        "Raja Ravi Varma was a celebrated Indian painter and artist. He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art for a number of aesthetic and broader social reasons. Firstly, his works are held to be among the best examples of the fusion of European techniques with a purely Indian sensibility. While continuing the tradition and aesthetics of Indian art, his paintings employed the latest European academic art techniques of the day. Secondly, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure. Indeed, his lithographs increased the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among common people for several decades. In particular, his depictions of Hindu deities and episodes from the epics and Puranas have received profound acceptance from the public and are found, often as objects of worship, across the length and breadth of India.",
        "Raja Ravi Varma was closely related to the royal family of Travancore of present-day Kerala state in India."

        "Hans Fredrik Gude was a Norwegian romanticist painter and is considered along with Johan Christian Dahl to be one of Norway's foremost landscape painters. He has been called a mainstay of Norwegian National Romanticism. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.",
        "Gude's artistic career was not one marked with drastic change and revolution, but was instead a steady progression that slowly reacted to general trends in the artistic world. Gude's early works are of idyllic, sun-drenched Norwegian landscapes which present a romantic, yet still realistic view of his country. Around 1860 Gude began painting seascapes and other coastal subjects. Gude had difficulty with figure drawing initially and so collaborated with Adolph Tidemand in some of his painting, drawing the landscape himself and allowing Tidemand to paint the figures. Later Gude would work specifically on his figures while at Karlsruhe, and so began populating his paintings with them. Gude initially painted primarily with oils in a studio, basing his works on studies he had done earlier in the field."

His introduction of mechanical movable type printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is regarded as a milestone of the second millennium, ushering in the modern period of human history. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.",

Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink for printing books; adjustable molds; mechanical movable type; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike."

His paintings are predominantly large-scale, freely-scribbled, calligraphic and graffiti-like works on solid fields of mostly gray, tan, or off-white colors. His later paintings and works on paper shifted toward \"romantic symbolism\", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted poets such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Rainer Maria Rilke and John Keats, as well as classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his Apollo and The Artist and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word \"VIRGIL\".",
        "Twombly's works are in the permanent collections of modern art museums globally, including the Menil Collection in Houston, the Tate Modern in London, New York City's Museum of Modern Art and Munich's Museum Brandhorst. He was commissioned for the ceiling at the Musée du Louvre in Paris."

        "Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily in sculpture and installation, but is also active in painting, performance, film, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts. Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan.",
        "Kusama was raised in Matsumoto, and trained at the Kyoto School of Arts and Crafts in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga. Kusama was inspired, however, by American Abstract impressionism. She moved to New York City in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the 1960s, especially in the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored polka dots. Since the 1970s, Kusama has continued to create art, most notably installations in various museums around the world."

When the main operation began the next morning, the offensive was countrywide and well coordinated; eventually more than 80,000 PAVN/VC troops struck more than 100 towns and cities, including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns, and the southern capital."

This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne. Grassroots community assemblies called 'Soviets', which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias."

        "The German Revolution or November Revolution was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of the German federal constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the adoption in August 1919 of the Weimar Constitution.",
        "The causes of the revolution were the extreme burdens suffered by the population during the four years of war, the strong impact of the defeat on the German Empire and the social tensions between the general population and the elite of aristocrats and bourgeoisie who held power and had just lost the war.",
        "The roots of the revolution lay in the German Empire's defeat in the First World War and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. The first acts of revolution were triggered by the policies of the German Supreme Command of the Army and its lack of coordination with the Naval Command. In the face of defeat, the Naval Command insisted on trying to precipitate a climactic battle with the British Royal Navy by means of its naval order of 24 October 1918."

  "idioms": [
    {
      "term": "hell-bent for leather",
      "definition": "Moving recklessly fast, as in *Out the door she went, hell- bent for leather.* The use of *hell-bent* in the sense of \"recklessly determined\" dates from the first half of the 1800s. *Leather* alludes to a horse's saddle and to riding on horseback; this colloquial expression may be an American version of the earlier British army jargon **hell for leather,** first recorded in 1889."
    },
    {
      "term": "go berserk",
      "definition": "Erupt in furious rage, become crazily violent. For example, *When they announced the gymnast's score, her coach went berserk.* This expression is believed to allude to the name of Norse warriors renowned for their ferocity in battle and for wearing no armor but a bearskin shirt (or *berserkar*). [Late 1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "peeping Tom",
      "definition": "A person who secretly watches others, especially for sexual gratification; a voyeur. For example, *The police caught a peeping Tom right outside their house.* This expression, first recorded in 1796, alludes to the legend of the tailor Tom, the only person to watch the naked Lady Godiva as she rode by and who was struck blind for this sin."
    },
    {
      "term": "fifth wheel",
      "definition": "An extra and unnecessary person or thing, as in *He was the only one without a date, so he felt like a fifth wheel.* This expression, which alludes to an unneeded wheel on a four-wheel vehicle, may have originated as long ago as 1631, when Thomas Dekker wrote *Match Me in London:* \"Thou tiest but wings to a swift gray Hounds heel, And addest to a running Chariot a fifth wheel.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "pay through the nose",
      "definition": "Pay an excessive amount for something, as in *We paid through the nose for that vacation.* The origin of this term has been lost. Possibly it alludes to the Danish nose tax, imposed in Ireland in the 9th century, whereby delinquent taxpayers were punished by having their noses slit. [Second half of 1600s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "high-water mark",
      "definition": "The peak of something, especially an achievement. For example, *This composition is the high-water mark of his entire output.* This expression alludes to the highest mark left on shore by the tide. [Mid-1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "build on sand",
      "definition": "Use an unstable foundation, as in *If you buy nothing but high-risk stocks, your portfolio will be built on sand.* This metaphor appears in the New Testament, where Jesus likens those who do not heed his sayings to a foolish man who builds his house on sand, which then is washed away by rain, flood, and wind (Matthew 7:24--27). [c. 1600]"
    },
    {
      "term": "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak",
      "definition": "One would like to undertake something but hasn't the energy or strength to do so. For example, *Another set of tennis? The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.* Today often used as a rueful admission of weariness or other physical weakness, this idiom was first recorded in the New Testament (Matthew 26:41), where Jesus tells his disciples: \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" A modern equivalent is **I would if I could but I can't.**"
    },
    {
      "term": "before you can say Jack Robinson",
      "definition": "Also, **quicker than you can say Jack Robinson.** Almost immediately, very soon, as in *I'll finish this book before you can say Jack Robinson.* This expression originated in the 1700s, but the identity of Jack Robinson has been lost. Grose's *Classical Dictionary* (1785) said he was a man who paid such brief visits to acquaintances that there was scarcely time to announce his arrival before he had departed, but it gives no further documentation. A newer version is **before you know it,** meaning so soon that you don't have time to become aware of it (as in *He'll be gone before you know it*)."
    },
    {
      "term": "bald as a coot",
      "definition": "Extremely bald, usually applied to a person. The coot is a water bird with a white bill that extends to its forehead, making it appear to be bald. The simile was first recorded in 1430."
    },
    {
      "term": "champ at the bit",
      "definition": "Show impatience at being held back or delayed, as in *The dismissal bell hadn't rung, but they were champing at the bit to leave.* This term transfers the action of a horse that impatiently bites the bit in its mouth to human behavior. [Mid-1600s]"

For example, *This recipe has turned out fine in the past, so leave well enough alone.* The idea behind this expression dates from ancient Greek times, specifically Aesop's fable about a fox who refused a hedgehog's offer to take out its ticks lest, by removing those that are full, other hungry ones will replace them. Put as *let well alone* from the early 1700s, it was first recorded as *let well enough alone* in 1827."

Six years later he changed it to \"Chinese Proverb: One Picture Is Worth Ten Thousand Words,\" illustrated with some Chinese characters.

Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party."

The city served as the capital in exile of the Umayyad Caliphate and various other emirates. During these Muslim periods, Córdoba was transformed into a world leading center of education and learning, producing notable figures such as Averroes, Ibn Hazm, and Al-Zahrawi, and by the 10th century it had grown to be the second-largest city in Europe. It was conquered by the Kingdom of Castile through the Christian Reconquista in 1236.",

He succeeded Foxton, but his controversial use of the short-drop method of hanging, in which the victims were strangled rather than had their vertebrae broken by the fall when the trapdoor on the gallows was released, caused some to consider him incompetent. Many took several minutes to die, and to hasten their deaths Calcraft sometimes pulled on their legs, or even climbed on their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. Calcraft's antics may have been intended to entertain the crowds of more than 30,000 that sometimes attended his executions before a change in the law in 1868 meant that executions could only take place in prisons. Among his victims were Marie and Frederick Manning, the first husband and wife to be hanged together since 1700. Calcraft died at Poole Street in Hoxton, on 13 December 1879."

Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient who spoke to him in unusual voices while sleeping. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's communications were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message.

The color of the caps changes with variations in hydration, and ranges from dark chestnut brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry. The species was first reported by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 as a variety of Psilocybe mexicana before he officially described it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the Aztec people, P. aztecorum may have been one of the sacred mushroom species, or teonanácatl (\"flesh of the gods\"), reported in the codices of 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún.

While dense jungle is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrain. It is strongly associated with the presence of water and is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is a largely solitary, stalk-and-ambush predator, and is opportunistic in prey selection. It is also an apex and keystone predator, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of prey species.

      "summary": "Lead(II) nitrate is a chemical compound, the inorganic salt of nitric acid and lead. It is a colourless crystal or white powder and a strong, stable oxidizer. Unlike most other lead(II) salts, it is soluble in water. Its main use from the Middle Ages, under the name plumb dulcis, has been as raw material in the production of many pigments. Since the twentieth century, it has been used industrially as a heat stabilizer in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Commercial production did not take place until the nineteenth century in Europe, and in the United States until after 1943, with a typical production process of metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid. Lead(II) nitrate is toxic and probably carcinogenic to humans."

It is sometimes referred to as the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect due to the lack of several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by I.I. Dubasov in 1950. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used by the nations of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria. In the center of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, superimposed over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colors of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets at the base of the emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language."

During the Malayan Emergency, he was senior air staff officer at RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters, Singapore. His other post-war appointments included Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Operational Command, and AOC Support Command. In January 1970, he was promoted to air marshal and became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Knighted in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland, where he attracted controversy by making comments critical of the Federal government. The British government refused to agree to his term being extended. He retired in March 1977, and died the following year."

Little is known of his life before 1596 when a distant relation, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, appointed him constable of Alnwick Castle. Percy acted as the earl's intermediary in a series of confidential communications with King James VI of Scotland. After James acceded to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with him, supposing that the new king had reneged on promises of toleration for English Catholics. He met Robert Catesby in 1603, and the following year joined his conspiracy to kill James and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy provided the group with funding and secured the leases to certain properties in London, including the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, into which the gunpowder was placed. When the plot was exposed on 5 November 1605, Percy fled to the Midlands. He and Catesby were killed on 8 November, during a siege of Holbeche House in Staffordshire, by the Sheriff of Worcester and his men."

      "summary": "A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which is in contact with both a cumulonimbus cloud base and the surface of the earth. Tornadoes can come in many sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, with the narrow end touching the earth. Often, a cloud of debris encircles the lower portion of the funnel. Most tornadoes have winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) or less, are approximately 250 feet (75 meters) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. However, some tornadoes can have winds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), be more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 kilometers). Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica; however, most of the world's tornadoes occur in the United States. Other areas which commonly experience tornadoes include New Zealand, western and southeastern Australia, south-central Canada, northwestern and central Europe, Italy, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America, and Southern Africa."

      "summary": "Resurrectionists (depicted in action) were commonly employed by anatomists in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries to disinter the bodies of the recently deceased for anatomical research. Between 1506 and 1752 only a very few cadavers were available each year. The supply was increased when, in an attempt to intensify the deterrent effect of the death penalty, the Murder Act 1752 allowed executed criminals to be dissected—a fate generally viewed with horror—in place of gibbeting. The change was insufficient to meet the needs of hospitals and teaching centres. Corpses and their component parts became a commodity, but although the practice of disinterment was hated by the general public, bodies were not legally anyone's property. Resurrectionists caught plying their trade ran the risk of attack. Measures taken to stop them included increased security at graveyards, secure coffins, and physical barriers. Matters came to a head following the Burke and Hare murders of 1828. Although it did not make body snatching illegal, the Anatomy Act 1832 effectively put an end to the work of the resurrectionists by allowing anatomists access to the workhouse dead."

It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location at the head of numerous canals and railroad lines. With the decline of heavy manufacturing, Cleveland's businesses have diversified into the service economy, including the financial services, insurance, and healthcare sectors. As of the 2000 Census, the city proper had a total population of 478,403, making it the 33rd largest city in the nation. Recent investments have provided the city with tourist attractions in the downtown area, such as Jacobs Field, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Playhouse Square Center. In studies conducted by The Economist in 2005, Cleveland and Pittsburgh were ranked as the most livable cities in the United States, and the city was ranked as the best city for business meetings in the continental U.S. Nevertheless, the city faces continuing challenges, in particular from concentrated poverty in some neighborhoods and difficulties in the funding and delivering of high-quality public education."

Eventually, Latin speakers began using \"numen\" to describe the special divine force of any object, place, or phenomenon that inspired awe (a mystical-seeming wooded grove, for example, or the movement of the sun), and \"numen\" made the semantic leap from \"nod\" to \"divine will or power.\" English speakers adopted the word during the 1600s.",

      "didYouKnow": "\"Supersede\" ultimately derives from the Latin verb \"supersedēre,\" meaning \"to be superior to,\" but it came to us through Middle English, where it was rendered \"superceden.\" It may be no surprise that modern English speakers can be confused about how to spell this word -- it sometimes turns up as \"supercede.\" In fact, the earliest record of the word in English shows it spelled with a \"c\" (although the \"s\" spelling has been the dominant choice since it first appeared in the 16th century). Although both spellings can be etymologically justified, \"supersede\" continues to be regarded as the \"correct\" version. \"Supercede\" can be considered a variant (albeit the less frequent one) after several centuries of use, but it still draws criticism.",

English speakers borrowed the word as \"galvanism\" in 1797; the verb \"galvanize\" was introduced in 1802. Charlotte Brontë, in 1853, used the verb figuratively in her novel _Villette_: \"Her approach always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life.\" These days, \"galvanize\" also means to cover metal with zinc or a zinc alloy to protect from rust (as in galvanized carpentry nails).",

This noun usage has not always been viewed in a favorable light.
