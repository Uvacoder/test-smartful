Though Suzhou's Wu School encouraged painting in ink washes, Qiu Ying also painted in the green-and-blue style. He painted with the support of wealthy patrons, creating images of flowers, gardens, religious subjects, and landscapes in the fashions of the Ming dynasty. He incorporated different techniques into his paintings, and acquired a few wealthy patrons. His talent and versatility allowed him to become regarded as one of the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty.",

        "Hokusai created the Thirty-Six Views both as a response to a domestic travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically The Great Wave print and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured Hokusai's fame both in Japan and overseas. As historian Richard Lane concludes, \"if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series\". While Hokusai's work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series that he gained broad recognition."

Working part-time with his father, who was a wood carver, Thorvaldsen won many honors and medals at the academy. He was awarded a stipend to travel to Rome and continue his education.",

Thorvaldsen is buried within the courtyard of the museum. In his time, he was seen as the successor of master sculptor Antonio Canova. His strict adherence to classical norms has tended to estrange modern audiences."

Friends like Michelangelo and Ariosto called him \"Fra Bastiano\".",

He was born at Serina Alta near Bergamo, a dependency of the Republic of Venice, but his recorded career all took place in or near Venice. He is called Palma Vecchio in English to distinguish him from Palma il Giovane, his great-nephew, who was also a painter.",
        "Palma is first recorded in Venice in 1510, but had probably already been there for some time. He was perhaps apprenticed to Andrea Previtali, who also came from Bergamo, and who returned there in 1511. Palma's earlier works show the influence of Giovanni Bellini, Previtali's master and by then the aged doyen of Venetian painting, but Palma came to follow the new style and subjects pioneered by Giorgione and Titian. After the deaths of Bellini and Giorgione, and the removal from Venice of Sebastiano del Piombo, Lorenzo Lotto and Previtali, before long Palma found himself, after Titian, the leading painter in Venice, much in demand until his early death at the age of 48."

        "Adriaen Brouwer was a Flemish painter active in Flanders and the Dutch Republic in the first half of the 17th century. Brouwer was an important innovator of genre painting through his vivid depictions of peasants, soldiers and other 'lower class' individuals engaged in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fighting, music making etc. in taverns or rural settings. Brouwer contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression. In his final year he produced a few landscapes of a tragic intensity. Brouwer's work had an important influence on the next generation of Flemish and Dutch genre painters."

        "Robert Campin, now usually identified with the Master of Flémalle, was the first great master of Flemish and Early Netherlandish painting. Campin's identity and the attribution of the paintings in both the \"Campin\" and \"Master of Flémalle\" groupings have been a matter of controversy for decades. Campin was highly successful during his lifetime, and thus his activities are relatively well documented, but he did not sign or date his works, and none can be securely connected with him. A corpus of work attached to the unidentified \"Master of Flémalle\", so named in the 19th century after three religious panels said to have come from a monastery in Flémalle. They are each assumed to be wings of triptychs or polyptychs, and are the Virgin and Child with a Firescreen now in London, a panel fragment with the Thief on the Cross in Frankfurt, and the Brussels version of the Mérode Altarpiece.",
        "Campin was active by 1406 as a master painter in Tournai, in today's Belgium, and became that city's leading painter for 30 years. He had attained citizenship by 1410, and may have studied under Jan van Eyck. His fame had spread enough by 1419 that he led a large and profitable workshop."

        "Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.",
        "Born to a German father and a mestiza mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoacán—now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum. Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until she suffered a bus accident at the age of eighteen, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems. During her recovery she returned to her childhood hobby of art with the idea of becoming an artist."

His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.",
        "In 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the \"pivotal\" figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the \"dean of the Impressionist painters\", not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also \"by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality\". Paul Cézanne said \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord\", and he was also one of Paul Gauguin's masters. Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to his work as \"revolutionary\", through his artistic portrayals of the \"common man\", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without \"artifice or grandeur\"."

        "Sir Peter Paul Rubens was a Flemish artist and diplomat. He is considered the most influential artist of Flemish Baroque tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation. Rubens was a painter producing altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects. He was also a prolific designer of cartoons for the Flemish tapestry workshops and of frontispieces for the publishers in Antwerp.",
        "In addition to running a large workshop in Antwerp that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated humanist scholar and diplomat who was knighted by both Philip IV of Spain and Charles I of England. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by Michael Jaffé lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop."

        "Caspar David Friedrich was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\".",
        "Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality."

Since 2005, we have implemented the groundwork necessary to introduce less toxic, more targeted drugs into clinical trials. New compounds are currently being tested in these trials and hold great promise for children who have not experienced positive results under the standard treatment protocol.",

A Spanish force under Archduke Albrecht besieged the fortress being held initially by a Dutch force which was reinforced by English troops under Francis Vere who became the town's governor. It was said \"the Spanish assailed the unassailable; the Dutch defended the indefensible.\" The commitment of both sides in the dispute over the only Dutch ruled area in the province of Flanders, made the campaign continue for more than any other during the war. This resulted in one of the longest and bloodiest sieges in world history: more than 100,000 people were killed, wounded or succumbed to disease during the siege.",
        "Ostend was resupplied via the sea and as a result held out for three years. A garrison did a tour of duty before being replaced by fresh troops, normally 3,000 at a time keeping casualties and disease to a minimum. The siege consisted of a number of assaults by the Spanish, including a massive unsuccessful assault by 10,000 Spanish infantry in January 1602 when governed by Vere."

Bartle Frere then sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana, followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at Rorke's Drift by a small force of British troops."

The civil war resumed with the Japanese defeat, and the CPC gained the upper hand in the final phase of the war from 1945–1949, generally referred to as the Chinese Communist Revolution.",
        "The Communists gained control of mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, forcing the leadership of the Republic of China to retreat to the island of Taiwan. A lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait ensued, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China."

They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. Of the estimated 70–85 million deaths attributed to World War II, around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front. The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations.",

In late 1940, the Allies had defeated the Italian 10th Army during Operation Compass and trapped the remnants at Beda Fomm. During early 1941, much of the Western Desert Force was sent to the Greek and Syrian campaigns. As German troops and Italian reinforcements reached Libya, only a skeleton Allied force remained, short of equipment and supplies.",
        "Operation Sonnenblume, forced the Allies into a retreat to the Egyptian border. A garrison, consisting mostly of the 9th Australian Division remained at Tobruk, to deny the port to the Axis, while the WDF reorganised and prepared a counter-offensive. The Axis siege of Tobruk began on 10 April, when the port was attacked by a force under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel and continued during three relief attempts, Operation Brevity, Operation Battleaxe and Operation Crusader."

Despite having an overwhelming superiority over the Germans in numbers, the invading Imperial Russian Army spread its forces thin and was defeated in the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes."

        "It began during the First World War, with the February Revolution that was focused in and around Petrograd, the capital of Russia at that time. The revolution erupted in the context of Russia's major military losses during the War, which resulted in much of the Russian Army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne. Grassroots community assemblies called 'Soviets', which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias."

This became the name by which he was known in later times. As Augustus, he retained the trappings of a restored Republican leader, but historians generally view his consolidation of power and the adoption of these honorifics as the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire."

      "term": "dog in the manger",
      "definition": "One who prevents others from enjoying something despite having no use for it. For example, *Why be a dog in the manager? If you aren't going to use those tickets, let someone else have them.* This expression alludes to Aesop's fable about a snarling dog that prevents horses from eating fodder that is unpalatable to the dog itself. [Mid-1500s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "rule the roost",
      "definition": "Be in charge, boss others, as in *In our division the chairman's son rules the roost.* This expression originated in the 15th century as *rule the roast,* which was either a corruption of *rooster* or alluded to the person who was in charge of the roast and thus ran the kitchen. In the barnyard a rooster decides which hen should roost near him. Both interpretations persisted for 200 years. Thomas Heywood (c. 1630) put it as \"Her that ruled the roast in the kitchen,\" but Shakespeare had it in *2 Henry VI* (1:1): \"The new-made duke that rules the roast,\" which is more ambiguous. In the mid-1700s *roost* began to compete with *roast,* and in the 1900s *roost* displaced *roast* altogether."
    },
    {
      "term": "the whole nine yards",
      "definition": "Everything that is relevant; the whole thing. For example, *He decided to take everything to college---his books, his stereo, his computer, his skis, the whole nine yards.* The source of this expression is not known, but there are several possibilities: the amount of cloth required to make a complete suit of clothes; the fully set sails of a three-masted ship where each mast carries three yards, that is, spars, to support the sails; or the amount of cement (in cubic yards) contained in a cement mixer for a big construction job. [Colloquial]"

    {
      "term": "it's an ill wind that blows no one any good",
      "definition": "A loss or misfortune usually benefits someone. For example, *They lost everything when that old shed burned down, but they got rid of a lot of junk as well---it's an ill wind.* This expression appeared in John Heywood's 1546 proverb collection and remains so well known that it is often shortened. It also gave rise to a much-quoted pun about the difficulty of playing the oboe, describing the instrument as *an ill wind that nobody blows good.*"
    },
    {
      "term": "charity begins at home",
      "definition": "One ought to be generous to one's family before helping others. For example, *She spends hours and hours on volunteer work and neglects the children, forgetting that charity begins at home.* This proverb was first recorded in English, in slightly different form, in John Wycliffe's *Of Prelates* (c. 1380): \"Charity should begin at himself.\""

    {
      "term": "rain check",
      "definition": "A promise that an unaccepted offer will be renewed in the future, as in *I can't come to dinner Tuesday but hope you'll give me a rain check.* This term comes from baseball, where in the 1880s it became the practice to offer paying spectators a rain check entitling them to future admission for a game that was postponed or ended early owing to bad weather. By the early 1900s the term was transferred to tickets for other kinds of entertainment, and later to a coupon entitling a customer to buy, at a later date and at the same price, a sale item temporarily out of stock."

    {
      "term": "fair-haired boy",
      "definition": "A favorite, a person who is given special treatment. For example, *Today the attorney general is the governor's fair-haired boy.* This term alludes to the preference for blond (\"fair\") hair over dark hair. [Late 1800s] A more recent synonym is **golden boy**, dating from the first half of the 1900s and alluding to gold as an item of value. For example, *Holding the directorship of both the Metropolitan Opera and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, James Levine was the golden boy of classical music.* Clifford Odets entitled his 1937 play *Golden Boy.*"
    },
    {
      "term": "star-chamber proceedings",
      "definition": "An unfair, secret judicial action. The term alludes to an inquisitorial English court that sat without a jury and was famous for its harsh judgments and sentences. Called the Court of the Star Chamber because of the stars gilded on its ceiling, it was abolished in 1641. The name, however, has persisted to the present day."
    },
    {
      "term": "peeping Tom",
      "definition": "A person who secretly watches others, especially for sexual gratification; a voyeur. For example, *The police caught a peeping Tom right outside their house.* This expression, first recorded in 1796, alludes to the legend of the tailor Tom, the only person to watch the naked Lady Godiva as she rode by and who was struck blind for this sin."
    },
    {
      "term": "for a song",
      "definition": "Very cheaply, for little money, especially for less than something is worth. For example, \"I know a man ... sold a goodly manor for a song\" (Shakespeare, *All's Well That Ends Well,* 3:2).

      "term": "misery loves company",
      "definition": "Fellow sufferers make unhappiness easier to bear, as in *She secretly hoped her friend would fail, too---misery loves company.* Words to this effect appeared in the work of Sophocles (c. 408 B.C.) and other ancient writers; the earliest recorded use in English was about 1349."

    {
      "term": "best bib and tucker",
      "definition": "One's finest clothes, dressed up, as in *The men were told to put on their best bib and tucker for the dinner dance.* Although wearing either a bib (frill at front of a man's shirt) or a tucker (ornamental lace covering a woman's neck and shoulders) is obsolete, the phrase survives. [Mid-1700s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "can't see beyond the end of one's nose",
      "definition": "Also, **can't see farther than the end of one's nose.** Lack foresight, envisioning only immediate events or problems, as in *Thomas hasn't hired an orchestra for the Christmas concert; he just can't see beyond the end of his nose.* This expression originated as a French proverb that was frequently cited in English from about 1700 on. Alexander Pope used a similar expression in his *Essay on Man* (1734): \"Onward still he goes, Yet ne'er looks forward further than his nose.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "spit and polish",
      "definition": "Close attention to appearance and order, as in *With a little spit and polish this house will sell very quickly.* This expression originated in the military, presumably alluding to literally shining up something with the aid of a little saliva.

    {
      "term": "swan song",
      "definition": "A final accomplishment or performance, one's last work. For example, *I'm resigning tomorrow; this project was my swan song.* This term alludes to the old belief that swans normally are mute but burst into beautiful song moments before they die.

    },
    {
      "term": "Occam's razor",
      "definition": "The idea that the simplest explanation is probably the best. William of Occam was a Franciscan friar and philosopher (c. 1280-1349) whose writings so angered the Pope that he was excommunicated. His original statement was *Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem* (Entities should not be multiplied more than necessary). It was a French philosopher, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in 1746 likened the idea to a razor, that is, cutting through complex ideas to reach the truth, and nearly a century later Sir William Hamilton, in an 1836 lecture, coined the present idiom. While it is not often heard today, it is not obsolete. Archer Mayor used it as the title of his 1999 mystery novel."
    },
    {
      "term": "c'est la vie",
      "definition": "That's life, there's nothing you can do about it. This French expression, often stated with a shrug, frequently is a response to some undesirable occurrence. For example, *You were caught with an expired driver's license; oh well, c'est la vie.* [mid-1800s]"

      "term": "time and tide wait for no man",
      "definition": "One must not procrastinate or delay, as in *Let's get on with the voting; time and tide won't wait, you know.* This proverbial phrase, alluding to the fact that human events or concerns cannot stop the passage of time or the movement of the tides, first appeared about 1395 in Chaucer's *Prologue to the Clerk's Tale.* The alliterative beginning, *time and tide,* was repeated in various contexts over the years but today survives only in the proverb, which is often shortened (as above)."
    },
    {
      "term": "warm as toast",
      "definition": "Comfortably warm, as in *It was freezing outside, but we were warm as toast in front of the fire.* Despite the British custom of serving toasted bread in a rack that rapidly cools it, this idiom originated in England, at first as *hot as toast* (c. 1430) and by the mid-1800s in its present form."
    },
    {
      "term": "rest on one's laurels",
      "definition": "Rely on one's past achievements, especially as a way of avoiding the work needed to advance one's status.

[Late 1800s]"

    {
      "term": "sling hash",
      "definition": "Serve food in a restaurant, especially a cheap establishment.

    {
      "term": "red herring",
      "definition": "Something that draws attention away from the central issue, as in *Talking about the new plant is a red herring to keep us from learning about downsizing plans.* The *herring* in this expression is red and strong-smelling from being preserved by smoking. The idiom alludes to dragging a smoked herring across a trail to cover up the scent and throw off tracking dogs. [Late 1800s]"
    },
    {
      "term": "get down to brass tacks",
      "definition": "Also, **get down to bedrock** or *the nitty gritty* or *cases.* Deal with the essentials; come to the point. For example, *Stop delaying and get down to brass tacks,* or *We really need to get down to bedrock,* or *He has a way of getting down to the nitty gritty,* or *Let's get down to cases.* The origin of the first phrase, dating from the late 1800s, is disputed. Some believe it alludes to the brass tacks used under fine upholstery, others that it is Cockney rhyming slang for \"hard facts,\" and still others that it alludes to tacks hammered into a sales counter to indicate precise measuring points. The noun *bedrock* has signified the hard rock underlying soil or geological deposits since about 1850 and has been used figuratively to denote \"bottom\" since the 1860s. The noun *nitty-gritty* dates from the mid-1900s and alludes to the detailed (\"nitty\") and possibly unpleasant (\"gritty\") issue in question. The noun *cases* apparently alludes to the game of faro, in which the \"case card\" is the last of a rank of cards remaining in play; this usage dates from about 1900."
    },
    {
      "term": "born with a silver spoon",
      "definition": "Born wealthy, or fortunate, or both, as in *Paul can afford to go to medical school; he was born with a silver spoon.* Although some authorities believe this phrase alludes to the custom of godparents giving their godchild a silver spoon, affordable only by rich persons, it is more likely that the spoon has come to symbolize wealth. [c. 1700]"
    },
    {
      "term": "know which side of one's bread is buttered",
      "definition": "Be aware of where one's best interests lie, as in *Jerry always helps out his boss; he knows which side of his bread is buttered.* This expression alludes to the more favorable, or buttered, side of bread and has been used metaphorically since the early 1500s."
    },
    {
      "term": "method in one's madness",
      "definition": "An underlying purpose in crazy behavior, as in *Harry takes seemingly random trips around the country but there's method to his madness---he's checking on real estate values.* This expression comes from Shakespeare's *Hamlet* (2:2): \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.\""
    },
    {
      "term": "leave well enough alone",
      "definition": "Also, **let well enough alone.** Do not try to change something lest you make it worse. For example, *This recipe has turned out fine in the past, so leave well enough alone.* The idea behind this expression dates from ancient Greek times, specifically Aesop's fable about a fox who refused a hedgehog's offer to take out its ticks lest, by removing those that are full, other hungry ones will replace them. Put as *let well alone* from the early 1700s, it was first recorded as *let well enough alone* in 1827."
    },
    {
      "term": "the balloon goes up",
      "definition": "The undertaking begins, as in *He's going to announce his candidacy for mayor---the balloon goes up on Monday.* This expression comes from World War I, when British artillery sent up a balloon to notify gunners to open fire, this visual signal being more reliable than courier or telephone. It was soon transferred to signal other kinds of beginning. [1915]"
    },
    {
      "term": "right as rain",
      "definition": "In good order or good health, satisfactory, as in *He was very ill, but he's right as rain now,* or *If she'd only worked on it another week everything would have been as right as rain.* The allusion in this simile is unclear, but it originated in Britain, where rainy weather is a normal fact of life, and indeed W.L. Phelps wrote, \"The expression 'right as rain' must have been invented by an Englishman.\" It was first recorded in 1894."
    },
    {
      "term": "mind one's p's and q's",
      "definition": "Practice good manners, be precise and careful in one's behavior and speech, as in *Their grandmother often told the children to mind their p's and q's.* The origin of this expression, first recorded in 1779, is disputed. Among the more interesting theories advanced is that bartenders kept track of customers' consumption in terms of *pints* (*p's*) and *quarts* (*q's*) and the phrase referred to an honest accounting; that school-children were taught to be careful in distinguishing the letters *p* and *q;* and that French dancing masters cautioned pupils about the correct performance of the figures *pieds* and *queues* (either abbreviated or mispronounced in English as *p's* and *q's*)."

He gave up his secular ambitions in his mid-thirties and took holy orders in the Church of England, spending the rest of his life as the rector of the little parish of St Andrew's Church, Lower Bemerton, Salisbury. He was noted for unfailing care for his parishioners, bringing the sacraments to them when they were ill and providing food and clothing for those in need.

      "summary": "The women's road race was one of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. It took place on 10 August 2008, featuring 66 women from 33 countries. Heavy rain during the entire race made conditions difficult for the competitors. A group of five was able to break away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where Nicole Cooke placed herself in position to win the race. Cooke earned Great Britain's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy won the silver and bronze medals respectively. The race also marked the first positive drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games, by María Isabel Moreno of Spain. It was the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event and featured a longer course than any of the previous six races. The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues), which is 102.6 kilometres (63.8 mi) in its entirety. Including a second lap around the 23.8 km (14.8 mi) final circuit, the total distance of the women's race was 126.4 km (78.5 mi), less than half the length of the men's race."

      "summary": "Mom & Me & Mom is the seventh book in author Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. The book was published in 2013, shortly before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday. It focuses on her relationship with her mother, Vivian Baxter. The book explains Baxter's behavior, especially her abandonment of Angelou and Angelou's older brother when they were young children. It also chronicles Angelou's reunion and reconciliation with Baxter. Mom & Me & Mom is an overview of Angelou's life and revisits many of the anecdotes related in her previous books. Angelou was one of the first African American female writers to openly discuss her life through autobiography, upholding the long traditions of African American autobiography but challenging the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Like Angelou's previous autobiographies, Mom & Me & Mom received mostly positive reviews. Most reviewers state that Baxter is presented well in the book. Pictures of Angelou, Baxter, and members of their family appear through the book. An audio version, read by Angelou, was released in CD form and as a digital download."

      "summary": "Charlie Chaplin (1889–1977) was a British comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the silent era. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \"the Tramp\" and is considered one of the most important figures of the film industry. His first screen appearance came in February 1914, after which he produced the popular features The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). Chaplin refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. He became increasingly political and his next film, The Great Dictator (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s was a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. Accused of communist sympathies, he was forced to leave the United States. The Tramp was abandoned in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), and A King in New York (1957). Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. His work is characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, and continues to be held in high regard."

The highway is known as Old National Pike because it follows the original alignment of the National Road. As the route of the historic National Road, there are many historic sites along Alt US 40, including the Casselman Bridge in Grantsville and the last remaining National Road toll gate house in Maryland, located in LaVale. When the National Freeway was built in western Maryland paralleling the old National Road, the part of the bypassed road between Keyser's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US 40, and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became Maryland Route 144 and U.S. Route 40 Scenic.

It was the tenth named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Juan formed southeast of Bermuda on September 24 and peaked at 105 mph (165 km/h) as it rapidly approached the coast of Nova Scotia, losing little intensity over the cooler waters. Juan made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia early on September 29 while still a Category 2 hurricane, and remained a hurricane across Nova Scotia and onto Prince Edward Island, weakening to a tropical storm over the island. It was absorbed by another extratropical low later on September 29 near Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The storm left extensive damage across central Nova Scotia and into Prince Edward Island, with lesser damage east and west of the storm center. Most of the damage was as a result of the high winds that whipped across the region. Juan resulted in eight fatalities and over $200 million (in 2003 USD) in damage. It was described as the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893."

The road is 107 miles (172 km) long; however, for seven miles, it shares its route with the M60 motorway around Manchester. The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and originally conceived as two separate routes, was built in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing in Tarbock. The motorway also absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960. Adjusted for inflation to 2007, the motorway cost approximately GB£765 million to build. The motorway is relatively busy, with an average daily traffic flow of 100,000 cars in Yorkshire, and has several areas prone to gridlock, in particular, between Leeds and Halifax in West Yorkshire. Since the Stretford-Eccles bypass was opened, the motorway's history beyond construction has included a coach bombing on 4 February 1974, and a rail crash on 28 February 2001."

As the war started, Union forces evacuating Norfolk burned the ships left behind. One was raised by the Confederates, renamed the CSS Virginia, and plated with iron—making it the first modern ironclad warship. On March 8, 1862, it sailed into Hampton Roads off Sewell's Point to challenge the blockading Union ships there, destroying several of them. The next day, it was engaged by the USS Monitor, a newly built Union ironclad. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, it is chiefly significant in naval history as the first battle between two powered ironclad warships, which came to be known as ironclads. Prior to then, warships were made primarily of wood. After the battle, ships and naval warfare changed dramatically, as nations around the world raced to convert their fleets to iron."

Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting, in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaborative effort between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was the one who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters in 2000. Despite initial backlash from fans due to the first-person perspective, the game was released to both universal acclaim and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone."

      "summary": "Gas metal arc welding is a semi-automatic or automatic arc welding process that utilizes a welding gun through which a continuous and consumable wire electrode and a shielding gas are fed. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. Originally developed for welding aluminum and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it allowed for lower welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry, where it is preferred for its versatility and speed. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility."

      "summary": "Epaminondas was a Theban general and statesman who transformed Thebes, leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a preeminent position in Greek geopolitics. In the process he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots—Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 200 years. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was militarily influential as well; he invented several major battlefield tactics. Cicero once called him \"the first man of Greece\", but Epaminondas has fallen into relative obscurity in modern times. The changes he wrought on the Greek political order did not long outlive him, as the cycle of shifting hegemonies and alliances continued unabated. Just 27 years after his death, a recalcitrant Thebes was obliterated by Alexander the Great. Thus Epaminondas—who had been praised in his time as an idealist and liberator—is today largely remembered for a decade (371 to 362 BC) of campaigning that sapped the strength of the great land powers of Greece and paved the way for the Macedonian conquest."

Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. Today, more than 12,000 species are classified with upper estimates of about 14,000 species. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and a distinctive node-like structure that forms a slender waist. Ants form colonies that range in size from a few tens of predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies which may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals that are mostly sterile females forming castes of workers, soldiers, or other specialised groups. Ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones and one or more fertile females called queens. Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. Ants dominate most ecosystems, and form 15–20% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success has been attributed to their social organisation, ability to modify their habitats, tap resources and defend themselves."

Born in Baltimore, Ruth was sent at age seven to St. Mary's, a reformatory where he learned baseball skills. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles. He began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including 714 career home runs. In his fifteen years with the Yankees, Ruth helped them win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that boosted baseball's popularity and made home runs a major factor in the sport. Ruth's unprecedented power and carousing lifestyle made him a larger-than-life figure in the \"Roaring Twenties\". One of the first five inductees into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture, and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time."

These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, \"legitimate\" Restoration drama; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.

His best-known orchestral compositions—Capriccio Espagnol, the Russian Easter Festival Overture, and the symphonic suite Scheherazade—are considered staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas. Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy tale and folk subjects. Rimsky-Korsakov left a considerable body of original Russian nationalist compositions. He prepared works by The Five for performance, which brought them into the active classical repertoire (although there is controversy over his editing of the works of Modest Mussorgsky). He also shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians during his decades as an educator. Rimsky-Korsakov is therefore considered \"the main architect\" of what the classical music public considers the Russian style of composition."

Open clusters are found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is occurring. They are usually less than a few hundred million years old: they become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic centre, as well as losing cluster members through internal close encounters. Young open clusters may still be contained within the molecular cloud from which they formed, illuminating it to create an H II region. Over time, radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud. Typically, about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will coalesce into stars before radiation pressure drives the rest away. Open clusters are very important objects in the study of stellar evolution. Because the stars are all of very similar age and chemical composition, the effects of other more subtle variables on the properties of stars are much more easily studied than they are for isolated stars."

Choe's diary accounts of his travels in China became widely printed in the 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also utilize his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences.

      "name": "Northern Pintail",
      "summary": "The Northern Pintail is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe, Asia and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusual for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly con-specific Eaton's Pintail is considered to be a separate species. It is a fairly large duck, with a long pointed tail that gives rise to the species' English and scientific names. The Northern Pintail's many names describe the male's two long black tail feathers, which in flight look like a single pin or twig. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle. The Northern Pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. When not breeding, it is highly gregarious, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck."

      "summary": "Sheerness is a town located beside the mouth of the River Medway on the northwest corner of the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent, England. With a population of 12,000, it is the largest town on the island. Sheerness began as a fort built in the sixteenth century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. After a Dutch attack in 1692, Samuel Pepys, the Secretary to the Admiralty, established a Royal Navy dockyard in the town, where warships were built and repaired until its closure in 1960. In the nineteenth century, Sheerness also became a seaside resort, when a pier and promenade were constructed. Industry remains an important part of the town, and the port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom's leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first co-operative societies and the world's first multi-storey building with a rigid metal frame."

      "summary": "The Illuminatus! Trilogy is a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson primarily between 1969 and 1971. The trilogy is a satirical, postmodern, science fiction-influenced adventure story; a drug-, sex- and magic-laden trek through a number of conspiracy theories, both historical and imaginary, which hinge around the authors' version of the Illuminati. The narrative often switches between third and first person perspectives and jumps around in time. It is thematically dense, covering topics like counterculture, numerology and Discordianism. The trilogy comprises the books The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple and Leviathan. The popularity of the word \"fnord\" and the 23 enigma can both be attributed to the trilogy. It remains a seminal work of conspiracy fiction, predating Foucault's Pendulum and The Da Vinci Code by decades."

The novel was inspired by the Jersey Shore Shark Attacks of 1916. In the film, the police chief of Amity Island, a summer resort town, tries to protect beachgoers from the predations of a huge great white shark by closing the beach, only to be overruled by the money-grubbing town council. After several attacks, the police chief proceeds to enlist the help of a marine biologist and later a professional shark hunter to kill the shark. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as marine biologist Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter Quint, Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as the greedy Mayor Vaughn. Jaws is regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history, as it is the father of the summer blockbuster movie."

Several months previously, rebellious Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas. Up to 260 Texians were garrisoned in the Alamo at various times. On February 23, 1836, Santa Anna and 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to the Alamo as the first step in a campaign to re-take Texas. In the final battle, all but two of the Texian defenders were killed, and 400–600 Mexican troops were killed or wounded. The battle has been the subject of numerous myths, spread by movie and television adaptations, including John Wayne's 1960 film The Alamo."

It was discovered in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the Palomar Observatory in the United States, and in 2005 by a team headed by J. L. Ortiz at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, though the latter claim has been contested. On September 17, 2008, it was accepted as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth. Haumea's extreme elongation makes it unique among known trans-Neptunian objects. Although its shape has not been directly observed, calculations from its light curve suggest it is an ellipsoid, with its greatest axis twice as long as its shortest. Nonetheless, its gravity is believed sufficient for it to have relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium, thereby meeting the definition of a dwarf planet. This elongation, along with its unusually rapid rotation, high density, and high albedo (due to a surface of crystalline water ice), are thought to be the results of a giant collision, which left Haumea the largest member of a collisional family that includes several large TNOs and its two known moons."

New York architects Trowbridge & Livingston conceived the current structure's Art Deco design, in association with Francis Keally. Much of the interior and exterior are made of marble. The Oregon State Capitol was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The Public Works Administration, part of the U.S. government, partially financed construction, which was completed during the Great Depression, in 1937.

The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analysed works in Western painting. Las Meninas shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some figures look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margarita is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, and two dwarfs. Las Meninas has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in Western art history. The Baroque painter Luca Giordano said that it represents the \"theology of painting\", while in the 19th century Sir Thomas Lawrence called the work \"the philosophy of art\"."

In 1958, he received international attention for his Requiem for strings which resulted in several commissions from across the world, and settled his reputation as the leading Japanese composer of the 20th century. He was the recipient of numerous awards, commissions and honours; he composed over 100 film scores and about 130 concert works for ensembles of various sizes and combinations. He also found time to write a detective novel and appeared frequently on Japanese television as a celebrity chef. In the foreword to a selection of Takemitsu's writings in English, conductor Seiji Ozawa writes: \"I am very proud of my friend Tōru Takemitsu.

The Republican incumbent, Mark Hanna, had been appointed by Governor Asa Bushnell on March 5, 1897, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Sherman; the appointment was only good until the legislature met and made its own choice. Republicans kept their majority in the election that November, apparently assuring Hanna's election once the new body met in January 1898. However, the Ohio Republican party was bitterly divided into two factions. Before the legislative session, the Democrats allied with a number of Republicans, seeking to defeat Hanna, and took control of both houses of the legislature. Intense politicking took place and some lawmakers went into hiding fearing pressure by the other side. The coalition decided on Cleveland Mayor Robert McKisson as their candidate the day before the balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the US Senate, which took no action."

While the Peterborough Chronicle is not professional history, it is one of the few first-hand accounts of the period 1070 to 1154 in England written in English and from a non-courtly point of view.

Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to take advantage of the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak, which allows gameplay at a 640 × 480 display resolution, instead of that system's standard 320 × 240 resolution. Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy and inspired by the Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron comics, the game takes place primarily between events in the films Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. The player controls Luke Skywalker, commander of the elite X-wing pilots known as Rogue Squadron. As the game progresses, Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the Galactic Empire in sixteen missions across various planets. Rogue Squadron received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's technical achievements and flight controls, but its use of distance fog and the lack of a multiplayer mode drew criticism."

In 1995, he became the founding director of the newly created Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam, Germany. Ehlers' research focused on the foundations of general relativity as well as on the theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. He had a keen interest in the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent popularizer of science."

Nowadays, however, the meaning of \"propagate\" can extend to the \"reproduction\" of something intangible, such as an idea or belief.

      "didYouKnow": "The invention of the mechanized printing press in the 15th century revolutionized the way books were produced, dramatically increasing the number and variety of works to be published and distributed to awaiting readers. \"Incunabulum\" first appeared in English in the 19th century, referring retroactively to those books produced in the first decades of printing press technology - specifically those printed before the year 1501, a date that appears to have been determined only arbitrarily. In Latin \"incunabulum\" is singular of \"incunabula,\" which translates literally to \"swaddling clothes\" or \"bands holding the baby in a cradle.\" The \"baby\" in this case is a figurative one, referring to a book that was produced when the art of printing was still in its infancy.",
